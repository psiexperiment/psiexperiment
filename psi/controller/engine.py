    '''
    Defines hardware-specific interface

    The user-defind attributes are ones set by the end-user of this library in
    their IO manifest. The IO manifest is system specific and describes the
    hardware they are using for data acquisition.

    User-defined attributes
    -----------------------
    name : string
        Name of the engine. Must be unique across all engines. This name is
        used for debugging and metadata purposes.
    master_clock : bool
        If true, this engine will provide a timestamp whenever it's requested
        via `get_ts`. This is typically used for software-timed events (events
        generated by the hardware will typically have a timestamp that's
        determined by the engine that controls that particular device).
    hw_ai_monitor_period : float (sec)
        Poll period (in seconds). This defines how quickly acquired (analog
        input) data is downloaded from the buffers (and made available to
        listeners). If you want to see data as soon as possible, set the poll
        period to a small value. If your application is stalling or freezing,
        set this to a larger value. This poll period is a suggestion, not a
        contract.
    hw_ao_monitor_period : float (sec)
        Poll period (in seconds). This defines how often callbacks for the
        analog outputs are notified (i.e., to generate additional samples for
        playout).  If the poll period is too long, then the analog output may
        run out of samples. This poll period is a suggestion, not a contract.

    Attributes
    ----------
    configured : bool
        True if the hardware has been configured.

    Notes
    -----
    When subclassing, you only need to implement the callbacks required by your
    hardware. For example, if your hardware only has analog inputs, you only
    need to implement the analog input methods.
