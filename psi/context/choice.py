Introduction
------------
This module contains a collection of generators that facilitate ordering of
sequences for an experiment. Each generator takes a sequence and returns a
single element on each call. The order of the elements returned depends on the
algorithm. A shallow copy of the sequence is created by the generator to
prevent side effects if the original sequence is reordered elsewhere. However,
if the sequence contains mutable objects, then any modification to the objects
will be reflected in the output of the generator.

Examples
--------
Modifying a sequence of immutable objects after passing it to the selector does
not affect the output of the selector:

    >>> sequence = [1, 3, 8, 9, 12, 0, 4]
    >>> choice = exact_order(sequence)
    >>> next(choice)
    1
    >>> sequence[1] = 2
    >>> sequence
    [1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 0, 4]
    >>> next(choice)
    3

However, if you have a sequence that contains a mutable object (e.g. a list),
then modifications to the mutable object will alter the output of the selector:

    >>> sequence = [1, [2, 3], 4, 5, 6]
    >>> choice = exact_order(sequence)
    >>> next(choice)
    1
    >>> sequence[1][0] = -5
    >>> next(choice)
    [-5, 3]

An error is also raised when an empty sequence is passed:

    >>> choice = ascending([])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: Cannot use an empty sequence

Notes for developers
--------------------
* When writing your own generator, use the check_sequence decorator to ensure
  that the sequence passed is a shallow copy that you can modify in-place
  without any side effects. This also ensures that if the original sequence is
  modified by outside code, it will not affect the output of the generator.
* All generators must be infinite (i.e. they never end) or raise a StopIteration
  error when the sequence is exhausted.
* Random sequences have a hard dependency on Numpy (the built-in Python random
  module is suboptimal for scientific work).
