Chirp calibration
.................
Screencast illustrating several key features of psiexperiment including:

* The dock layout (which allows individual tabs to be rearranged)
* The ability to select a parameter to acquire multiple values at (i.e., we want to acquire responses at two chirp levels, -40 and -400 dB attenuation). For calibration experiments, stimulus levels are typically specified as dB attenuation instead of dB SPL. 
* Real-time plotting and analysis of acquired data (note that the data is automatically broken down by chirp level).

DPOAE acquisition
.................

Another screencast showing a DPOAE acquisition experiment. As in the previous screencast, this illustrates several features including:

* Rearranging dock items (the layout can be saved for future reuse if desired).
* Selecting two parameters for which we want to acquire multiple values (i.e., F2 frequency and F2 level) and real-time plotting and analysis of acquired data (i.e., the FFT and DPOAE levels).
